Generalized Todo list:

* Detect cars and bounding boxes around cars using YOLO

* Use vehicle information to find distance to car so we can find the speed of the car

* Setup hardware for real use

* Transfer code from Python to C++
    - One thing about this is it may be simpler to wait until we have a working
    Python variant before moving to C++ as we will not have to worry about any
    complications in C++ during development.

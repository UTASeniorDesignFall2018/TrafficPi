Performance is vital to our program because we will need a high frames per second count to accurately calculate the speed of a vehicle passing by. To make this easier, we will use YOLO for the object recognition. YOLO is great for this because it only passes over the image once to look for a vehicle, so it has very little load on the device itself. This would allow us to reach a higher FPS than if we used other object recognition algorithms. Another important performance requirement is that we will have to record at least 24 hours of video for the study. To help this, one idea we have mentioned is caching the video is memory and only saving it when a vehicle is detected moving through the frame.

\subsection{Accurate speed calculation}
\subsubsection{Description}
We need to keep at least 30, but ideally 60 fps to make sure that our algorithm calculates the speed accurately.

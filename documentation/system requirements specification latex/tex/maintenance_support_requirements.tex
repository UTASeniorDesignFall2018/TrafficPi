The main maintenance challenge for Traffic Pi will be servicing faulty equipment once it has been shipped to the customer. This does not mean that rigorous testing will not be performed however. Software patches pushed from the information website to a faulty Traffic Pi will be able to fix software related issues. Employees from the company will be able during normal business hours to answer questions from concerned customers concerning the product. The information website will have a section dedicated to common questions, potentially common fixes to faulty systems, and basic steps in maintaining the device. A demonstration video will also be provided to aide in the usage of the Traffic Pi by the customer.

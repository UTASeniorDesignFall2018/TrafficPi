A portion of the Traffic Pi physical assembly unit will have a section that will make mounting of the system to a physical environment easier. There are no other requirements for the Traffic Pi system. The core requirements are present in the Customer Requirements section as specified by the stakeholder, Dr. McMurrough. Other requirements that are encountered over the development of this system will be systematically added to this section.

The Traffic Pi will come as a ready to deploy system. This means that upon delivery of the system to a customer, the only setup required by the customer is to turn on the system, point the device's camera at the area of interest (either through use of a tripod or using the Traffic Pi's mounting area to mount to a surface), and engage the system. The Traffic Pi will come preloaded with the software needed to run the system as well as interface with the offsite server.

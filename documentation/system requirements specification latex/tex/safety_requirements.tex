To make sure our product is safe enough for public use, we will package our device in a 3D-printed shell with a transparent material for the camera to view from. We are still discussing what the transparent layer for the camera will be, but we will need to make sure that it will not shatter if the Traffic Pi is hit by a vehicle or dropped. Our product will likely use infrared lights to be able to view cars coming at night, but it will not be of any concern to users.

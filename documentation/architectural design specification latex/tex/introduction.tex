The system as a whole is designed to record passing traffic and run an analysis on collected data in order to produce a coherent collection of cars breaking the speed limit to determine if further civil actions need to be taken to increase the safety of the road.  The system requires a mounted case that will contain a raspberry pi computer attached to multiple cameras.  These cameras will record the traffic of a nearby road, saving video files of sections when cars have passed.  This information will be processed on a host computer once the device has been taken in and connected.  An application will analyze the data and provide results back to the user.

The success of this project will be determined by a number of milestones listed below.
\\
\\
At the end of nine month design and development period success will of the project will be assessed based on if the following criteria have been met:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system is able to accurately determine the speed of a vehicle within its field of view
  \item The system is able to reliably perform for at least one week
  \item The overall cost of the system is within \$800 dollars
  \item The system is able to output the data in a user friendly format
\end{itemize}
\\
Within 12 months after the prototype has been designed and developed these success indicators will be used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system will be able filter anything except vehicles out of its input data
  \item The system will be able to transfer the data on its computer to a cloud server
  \item The system will be able to perform increased analytics on the data in the cloud server
  \item The system will be able to interface with a mobile device
  \item The system will be able to generate a traffic model of the area of interest
\end{itemize}
\\
Within 16 months after the prototype delivery date, we expect the following success indicators to be observed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The overall cost of the system being reduced by \%15
  \item The system will be able to connect to other deployed systems, thereby monitoring a wider area
  \item The system will be able to generate a traffic model of multiple areas of interest and their possible correlations
\end{itemize}

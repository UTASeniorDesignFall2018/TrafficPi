As this project is the brain child of Dr. McMurrough, he is the only actual stakeholder in this endeavour. The product that is being developed is still only a prototype and has no committed customer that can be relied considered a stakeholder. As such, the team, over the course development cycle, will interact directly with Dr. McMurrough on developing a firm direction and tangible requirements that the system will have. 

The team consists of Ethan Duff, Jacob Devasier, Kevin Tiller, Miguel Fraire, and Seth Tisbi. There are no specific roles that have been assigned to any team member. Each member is resonsible in equal part for all development that will take place.

The roles of product owner and scrum master will be rotated through the team, allowing each member to own the responsibility that comes with the role.

To circumvent the traditional approach to a traffic study, the team envisions a solution that uses a micro-controller controller camera unit that can be mounted on tripod or attached to the side of a house. The camera will record in real time the traffic flow at an intersection, thoroughfare, or area of interest to the traffic study. Using an object recognition program along with analysis of pixel data, the speed of vehicles passing through the cameras vision will be monitored. This data will be sent to a centralized cloud server that will be able to run increased analytics on the vehicle, taking the raw data of speed, direction, etc. and outputting a user friendly report based the input data.

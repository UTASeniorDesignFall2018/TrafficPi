The project solution will consist of a camera connected to a micro-controller that will be attached to a fixed point on the deployed location. 

Power for the micro-controller and camera will be supplied through a power cable connected from the deployed location, in this example a house, to the micro-controller and camera. The micro-controller will be able to connect remotely to a cloud server. 

Data will be stored on the micro-controller and then transmitted to the cloud storage. The data stored in the cloud will be analyzed and output usable friendly information. The micro-controller will also be able to receive communication from the cloud storage.

The current system process for conducting initiating, conducting, and utilizing traffic studies involves an appeal from the citizens of a particular neighborhood to the city, an expensive ‘pneumatic road tube’ for measuring traffic, and the subsequent placement of speed bumps, stop signs, or signal lights for what may be just a rogue driver. This project aims to empower the citizen to conduct their own traffic study at fraction of the cost of the traditional method, provide the city with an efficient and cost effective alternative to the traditional method, provide more information on the vehicles in the traffic study, and utilize a crowd sourced repository of traffic data to improve traffic conditions in a neighborhood or city as a whole.

The team anticipates spending some time in the senior deign lab using the 3D printing equipment. We have intentions of designing and prototyping a secure and weatherproof enclosure for our components (Raspberry Pi, camera, backup battery, ect...). Regarding testing grounds for our equipment, it is possible that the Traffic Pi could be initially tested at a parking lot. Eventually, the Traffic Pi will have to tested in some residential neighborhood. Once initial testing is complete the plan consists of visiting one of these neighborhoods to ask a few residents for their permission to deploy the Traffic Pi equipment outside of their house for a given amount of time. If this doesn't work out, we could always ask the university to for their permission to deploy the Traffic Pi somewhere on campus.
